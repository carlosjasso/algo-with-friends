# Algo with friends

This project holds algorithms and data structures practice solutions to various coding challenges.

## âš™ Setup

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)+ is recommended.
- Seting up a python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is highly recommended. e.g. `python -m venv .venv`.
- Coding solutions are meant to be written as [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
- The [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file can be referenced to install the jupyter notebooks library via `pip`. e.g `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## ðŸ’» Contribution guidelines

To add any new code:

- Every contributor must create a branch with their name for them to add their solutions.
- Once new challenges get added to the trunk, each contributor should merge the trunk to their branch.
- If a new notebook, challenge or correction is to be added to the trunk, a pull request must be created to merge the new branch to the trunk.
- Pull requests must have at least 1 reviewer who is not the developer who created it.
- In the solution code, try to use as little python [magic âœ¨](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(programming)) as possible. Keep it simple.
