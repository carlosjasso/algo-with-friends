# Algo with friends

This project holds algorithms and data structures practice solutions to various coding challenges.

## âš™ Setup

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)+ is recommended
- Coding solutions are meant to be written as [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
- Seting up a python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is highly recommended. e.g. `python -m venv .venv`
- The [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file can be referenced to install the jupyter notebooks library via `pip`. e.g `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ðŸ’» Add code

To add any new code:

- One must create a new branch in which new code is added, this can help add new challenges, notebooks or solutions
- A pull request must be created to merge the new branch to the trunk
- The pull request must have at least 1 reviewer who is not the developer who created the branch
- In the solution code, try to use as little python [magic âœ¨](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(programming)) as possible. Stay primitive
