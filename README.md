# Algo with friends

This project holds algorithms and data structures practice solutions to various coding challenges.

## âš™ Setup

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)+ is recommended
- Coding solutions are meant to be written as [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
- Seting up a python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is highly recommended. e.g. `python -m venv .venv`
- The [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file can be referenced to install the jupyter notebooks library via `pip`. e.g `pip install -r requirements.txt`
